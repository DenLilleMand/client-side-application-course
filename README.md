# Learn how to build and architect modern client side applications with React at e-conomic

Interested in learning how to build client side application with React and Redux?  Look no further. This spring e-conomic will host a weekly class, where you can come and learn together with full time developers, that want to learn as well. We will create a space in e-conomic's development department where you have the time to learn, and where you can get help and feedback, in a nice environment in central Copenhagen. At e-conomic we have been pushing code using React to production for more than 2 years and we would love to share our experiences and learnings with you.

## What will we be doing? 
We will watch and follow the curriculum of an online course, and we will complement with our own experiences. It is therefore important that you can work independently and already have some basic programming background. We will try to cover a lot of material and also understand things in depth. So expect to spend at least one full day a week on this course. You will get weekly supervison, code review, and feedback from 3 professional developers, that will follow the course with you. To round off the course you will build an application, that could potentially be market ready. We will pitch some ideas for what you can build, but it is up to you. The goal is to build an application that includes a substantial part of the material we have covered.
__More exact course contents will be announced soon.__

## Ok, so how much is it?
It's free. We have limited slots open, but the course is free of charge. While e-conomic will supply the location, coffee, and fresh fruit, you must bring your own hard- and software.

## So what is the catch?
There is no catch. We at e-conomic would like to get contact to new and future developers, and show you that e-conomic is a nice place to spend your working hours. We will not dictate what kind of app you can and cannot build. The aim of this course is for you to learn! No strings attached.

## Practicalities
Direct any questions to our developer Morten at mha@e-conomic.com. The classes will be weekly __on day and time yet to be determined__. Last course day will be around 1st of June, or before end of semesters at the universities..

## Prerequisites
This course will not cover the basics of programming and computer science. Before attending this course you must have some programming experience. In particualar, you should have touched upon developing client-side applications and be comfortable with javascript.

Furthermore, as you will be working together with other students, you must have some basic knowledge of working with revision control software. At e-conomic we use Git, and we strongly urge you to do so too. While we will gladly help you, there will be no lessons on Git.

If we decide to teach React Native, students will have to run OS X, since React Native is only supported only on OS X
