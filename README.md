# Learn how to build and architect modern client side applications with React at e-conomic

Interested in learning how to build client side application with React and Redux?  Look no further. This spring e-conomic will host a weekly class, where you can come and learn together with full time developers, that want to learn as well. We will create a space in e-conomic's development department where you have the time to learn, and where you can get help and feedback, in a nice environment in central Copenhagen. At e-conomic we have been pushing code using React to production for more than 2 years and we would love to share our experiences and learnings with you.

## What will we be doing? 
We will watch and follow the curriculum of an online course, and we will complement with our own experiences. It is therefore important that you can work independently and already have some basic programming background. We will try to cover a lot of material and also understand things in depth. So expect to spend at least one full day a week on this course. You will get weekly supervison, code review, and feedback from 3 professional developers, that will follow the course with you. To round off the course you will build an application, that could potentially be market ready. We will pitch some ideas for what you can build, but it is up to you. The goal is to build an application that includes a substantial part of the material we have covered.
__More exact course contents will be announced soon.__

## Ok, so how much is it?
It's free. We have limited slots open, but the course is free of charge. While e-conomic will supply the location, coffee, and fresh fruit, you must bring your own hard- and software.

## So what is the catch?
There is no catch. We at e-conomic would like to get contact to new and future developers, and show you that e-conomic is a nice place to spend your working hours. We will not dictate what kind of app you can and cannot build. The aim of this course is for you to learn! No strings attached.

## Practicalities
Direct any questions to our developer Morten at mha@e-conomic.com. The classes will be weekly __on day and time yet to be determined__. Last course day will be around 1st of June, or before end of semesters at the universities..

## Prerequisites
This course will not cover the basics of programming and computer science. Before attending this course you must have some programming experience. In particualar, you should have touched upon developing client-side applications and be comfortable with javascript.

Furthermore, as you will be working together with other students, you must have some basic knowledge of working with revision control software. At e-conomic we use Git, and we strongly urge you to do so too. While we will gladly help you, there will be no lessons on Git.

# Course description

## Syllabus 

Please note, this outline is an approximation for the course schedule. At e-conomic we take a lean approach to software development, and we will take the same approach with the course; we can make adjusments to the lectures as the course progresses.

 * Week 1: Hello + Practicalities. 
   * why this course?
   * a few words on __JavaScript__
   * what is a __client application__?
   * Superficial React intro
   * build your first React app 
 * Week 2: Dive into __React__
   * Why React? Design considerations behind React, virtual DOM, how it works
   * Motivation behind React
 * Week 3: Dependency management
   * understanding modules
   * __npm__
   * __webpack__
   * Deploy the application
 * Week 4: One way data flow - __Flux__ part 1
   * What is Flux and why should I care
 * Week 5: One way data flow - __Flux__ part 2
 * Week 6: __(Im)mutable data__
   * How does mutability of data affect us?
   * How can we overcome that? Immutable data!
   * __Immutable.js__
 * Week 7: Application state
   * How is app state kept track of?
   * How can we improve?
   * __Redux__
 * Week 8: Testing client-side applications part 1
   * Testing... Javascript... WTF?!
 * Week 9: Testing client-side applications part 2
 * Week 10: __Static typing in JS__
   * Static in a dynamic world
   * __Flow__
 * Week 11 - project
 * Week 12 - project
 * Week 13 - project

__If__ time permits we will also look into building cross-platform client applications for __iOS__ and __Android__ with __React Native__. 

## Project description (ITU version)

<i>For ITU students. The following is a draft for what a project description could look like in the ITU project base, as an independent ECTS approved project.</i>

<b>Project titel (Dansk):</b> //TODO

<b>Project title (English):</b> Developing Client Side applications with JavaScript and ReactJs

<b>Problem statement:</b> Learn how to develop client side web applications written in JavaScript and using ReactJs library. This is not possible through any other course currently offered at ITU.

<b>Method:</b> Take weekly lectures led by three full-time developers from e-conomic. The lectures will cover material taught in relation to the syllabus of the course. Lectures will be held at e-conomic international at their office on Langebrogade in Copenhagen. We will wrap up the course by developing a small client-side web application that, as a minimum, incorporates the theory which has been presented throughout the lectures. Students will present their final projects in teams of 2 or 3.

<b>After the project the student must demonstrate a solid understanding of:</b>

* the Javascript programming language and reflect upon differences and parallels to previously know programming languages e.g. Java or C#
* the characteristics of a client application
* the design decision behind ReactJs
* what the virtual DOM is and how it affects HTML rendering and processing performance
* the flux design pattern and how it differs to MVC, MVVM design patterns
* the differences between immutable and mutable data structures
* designing and writing unit tests in Javascript
* static vs dynamic typing in Javascript

To hand in: An client web application that involves the fundamental concepts covered throughout the course. This should include, but is not limited to, creating custom react components, integration with a web service, local persistence. A short technical paper (8-10 pages) discussing the implementation.
