## Week1 

What did we talk about:
After en introduction to e-conomic and our workplace, we started with talking ablout what we mean when we say that we're gonna work with client-side applications. We mean javascript-applications-runniing-in-the-browser. We are not gonna touch nodejs apps, mobile apps etc.
Futhermore we are not gonna touch css or styling in general.

We watched an introductionvideo of react by Facebook, explaining the very basics about react and how to create simple examples.

We continued with our first assignments.

Assignment 1: a simple app that register a validated message from an input field and shows it in a specified container. All messages should be kept and be shown in order. Messages that failed validation show be shown in red together with an error message.

Assignment 2: do the same as ass 1, but by using react. Do a simple selfcontained component that handle all from validation to outputting

But assignments should be submitted as pull-requests on github.

How to create a pull-request:

* get lastest from master (`git pull`)
* checkout a new branch based on master (`git checkout -b <new-branch-name> `) - remember the naming convention "`<name>-week-<X>-ass-<Y>`"
* do your work
* commit your changes (`git add` + `git commit`)
* maybe do some more work, commit again
* push all changes to the remote - in our case github - (`git push -u origin <new-branch-name>`)  
_the first push of a new local branch is also like this, but any future commits and be pushed just by `git push` from that branch_

Finally, go to github and promote your newly created branch to an open pull-request

*We expect to have all assignments submitted within this week - before the weekend.

For questions we are on Slack, github (use the Issues) or email.
